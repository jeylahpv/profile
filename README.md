# Jey's Profile

This is my first attempt at creating a repository and creating a README file to display my profile to everyone!

My goal is to become a software developer and this is my first time taking a computer science course at UCF therefore making it the first step toward my journey.

I personally love to look back to my past to see how far I've grown along the way. That being said I hope one day to look back to this first little assignment that eventually will lead me to where I want to be in the future :)
